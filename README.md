# Transportation Carefer Task

## Bus Ticket Reservation Transportation API

The Bus Ticket Reservation Transportation API allows users to easily search for available bus routes, view bus schedules and prices, and make reservations for a specific seat on a bus. The API includes endpoints for searching for trips or routes, viewing bus schedules, reserving seats, and managing reservations. The API uses standard HTTP requests and returns data in JSON format. This documentation provides detailed information on the available endpoints, their parameters, and the expected responses. Additionally, it provides examples of how to use the API with the Postman collection to help you get started quickly and easily.
